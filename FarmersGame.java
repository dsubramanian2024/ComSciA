He has a boat that can only fit himself and one other thing, either the cabbage, the sheep, or the wolf. The problem is that he cannot leave the wolf and sheep alone on the river bank because the wolf would eat the sheep. Also, he cannot leave the sheep and the cabbage alone on the river bank because the sheep would eat the cabbage.To win the game, you must determine how to take all the items one at a time from one bank to the other. If the wolf and the sheep are left alone on one bank, or the sheep and the cabbage are left alone on one bank, you lose the game. Good Luck!");
